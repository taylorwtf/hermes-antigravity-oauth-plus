"""Regression tests for client lifecycle robustness (issues #10 and #4).

Two pre-existing hazards pinned here:

Issue #10 -- cyclic-GC self-deadlock on client._lock
    A suspended ``AntigravityStream._stream_generator`` forms a reference
    cycle with the stream (``stream._generator`` <-> frame <-> stream), so
    an ABANDONED stream (consumer stopped iterating without ``close()``) is
    reclaimable only by the cyclic GC, whose pass can fire while the SAME
    thread already holds the non-reentrant ``client._lock`` (e.g. inside
    ``client.close()``). The GC-finalized generator's ``finally`` then runs
    ``stream.close()`` -> ``client._terminate_worker()`` or the worker
    success path's ``client._update_worker_history()``, both of which do
    ``with self._lock`` on the thread that already holds it. Fix: an RLock
    (see client.AntigravityClient.__init__). The tests below reproduce the
    hazard deterministically -- a helper thread holds ``_lock`` and runs
    ``gc.collect()``, so the finalizer re-enters the lock on that same
    thread -- and guard every wait with a watchdog timeout so a regression
    FAILS the test instead of hanging pytest.

Issue #4 -- Windows temp-dir cleanup PermissionError (WinError 32)
    On Windows, ``taskkill /F /T`` is asynchronous, so a freshly killed agy
    child can still hold ``conversations/*.db`` when
    ``TemporaryDirectory.cleanup()`` runs. Fix: bounded retries with short
    backoff plus a forced-removal fallback in ``_remove_temp_dir``. All
    tests are mocked; live Windows verification by the reporter is pending
    on the issue.

Deliberate difference from the other suites: the clients here are NOT
registered for ``addCleanup(client.close)``. In the bug-present case the
deadlocked helper thread holds ``client._lock`` forever, so calling
``close()`` from a cleanup hook would block pytest forever; the tests
close the client explicitly on the success path only, and the per-test
TemporaryDirectory cleanup still removes the workspace.

    """W2: a stream finalized long after its turn must be inert.

    Same root cause as issue #10: the RLock lets a GC-finalized
    generator's ``finally`` run to completion instead of deadlocking, so
    cleanup that used to (accidentally) be blocked by the deadlock now
    actually executes -- at an arbitrary later time, on an arbitrary
    thread, against state that may have moved on. Two ownership guards
    keep that execution inert:

    * ``_worker_lock_held`` -- the lock is released only by the stream
      whose turn actually acquired it, never via a ``locked()`` probe
      (``threading.Lock`` is not owner-bound, so a probe cannot tell "my
      lock" from "someone else's" and a stale finalizer would unlock a
      live turn underneath its owner).
    * a proc-identity check -- ``close()`` terminates the worker only if
      ``self.proc`` is still the client's current worker, so a stale
      stream cannot kill the fresh worker serving a later turn.
