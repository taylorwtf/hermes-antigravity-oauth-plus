        Each ``next()`` runs on this stream's PRIVATE single-thread executor

        one). The shared default executor is deliberately not used: one
        ``readline()`` can occupy its thread for the whole request timeout
        (300s by default), and starving every other ``run_in_executor(None,
        ...)`` user in the host loop for that long is not acceptable.

        The closed check comes FIRST, before the executor is touched: after
        ``close()`` or exhaustion the executor is retired, and submitting to a
        dead executor raises RuntimeError -- a closed stream is simply done,
        so ``StopAsyncIteration`` is the caller-visible outcome.

        The worker-side stop sentinel from ``_pull_chunk`` is mapped back to
        ``StopAsyncIteration`` so ``async for`` terminates exactly like the
        sync ``for`` loop; every other exception propagates unchanged, after
        the same ``close()`` the sync path performs.

        Known limitation (documented, deliberately not fixed): awaiting the
        stream object itself only yields the stream, so a consumer still
        drives the subprocess chunk by chunk from worker threads. Per-chunk,
        not per-request, non-blocking is the best a plugin can do without a
        Hermes hook that would hand out a coroutine from create().

        Cancelling an in-flight ``__anext__`` (e.g. a ``wait_for`` timeout)
        leaves the stream unclosed: the worker lock stays held, the worker
        process stays alive, and the private executor's worker stays blocked
        in ``readline()`` until something calls ``close()``. Hermes' own
        ``_aggregate_chat_stream_async`` supplies that ``close()`` on
        realistic paths -- its ``finally`` runs ``_close_chunk_stream(chunks,
        allow_aclose=True)``, which finds this class's sync ``close()`` --
        matching the sync behavior of abandoning a stream without calling
        ``close()``. No ``CancelledError`` handler is added here on purpose:
        reacting to cancellation would change the close/terminate semantics,
        which is out of scope for this fix. A stream neither consumed nor
        closed keeps its executor thread (non-daemon, like every
        ThreadPoolExecutor thread) blocked until the process exits; the same
        is true of an abandoned sync stream's subprocess, and closing the
        client terminates the child, unblocking the read.
