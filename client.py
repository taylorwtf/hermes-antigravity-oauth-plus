# (taskkill /F /T) is asynchronous, so a child -- or a grandchild -- can
# still hold conversations/*.db for a short moment after termination
# returns, and TemporaryDirectory.cleanup() then raises PermissionError.
# Three quick attempts (0.1s, then 0.25s apart) cover that handle-release
# window: the worst case adds ~0.35s to a close() that was failing anyway,
# while the normal case (POSIX, or Windows where the handle is already
# gone) succeeds on the first attempt and pays none of it. After the last
# attempt a forced removal drops whatever is still unlocked, so close()
# never raises and never leaves the workspace behind needlessly.
#
# The tuple is the single source of truth for the retry budget: the
# attempts count is DERIVED from it (one try plus one backoff per retry),
# so extending the budget can never desynchronize the two -- a longer
# budget than tuple would index past its end and the IndexError would be

    """Best-effort forced removal of a workspace; never raises (issue #4).

    ``shutil.rmtree(path, ignore_errors=True)`` alone is WEAKER than the
    ``tempfile._rmtree`` that ``TemporaryDirectory.cleanup()`` uses:
    the latter chmod-resets read-only subtrees and retries them, the
    former silently skips them, which is exactly the residual leak this
    issue is about (a read-only ``conversations`` tree surviving the
    forced pass on the Windows shape of the bug). So: forced removal
    first; if anything survives, grant the owner write (and, for
    directories, search) permission -- the POSIX analogue of "the handle
    is gone now, try again" -- and sweep once more.

    The permission sweep deliberately SKIPS links using ``os.lstat`` so
    nothing is ever followed:

    * ``setup_isolated_home`` links the user's REAL OAuth token into the
      isolated HOME with ``os.symlink``, ``os.link``, or a ``copy2``
      fallback (process.py). A surviving token link is precisely the
      residual-leak shape of #4, and following it would chmod the user's
      real 0400 token OUTSIDE the workspace to 0600 -- out-of-scope
      permission widening on user data, on the exact path this issue is
      about. The residual link is a documented lesser evil. The
      hardlink case (the ``os.link`` fallback, ``st_nlink > 1``) is
      skipped for the same reason -- that inode is the user's token.
      On Windows the skip is deliberate for an additional reason:
      DeleteFile fails with ACCESS_DENIED on a file carrying
      FILE_ATTRIBUTE_READONLY, unlike POSIX where unlinking needs only
      parent-directory write, so a readonly hardlinked file -- and its
      now-unneeded parent chain -- survives removal THERE. Clearing
      that attribute would clear it on the shared file record, i.e. on
      the user's real token: the same out-of-scope widening the skip
      exists to prevent. That Windows remnant is accepted on purpose;
      the field shape (agy writes tokens writable, and #4's actual
      conversations/*.db is nlink=1) is swept and removed normally.
      On macOS, ``setup_isolated_home`` also links the user's real
      ``~/Library/Keychains`` directory into the isolated HOME
      (``_link_macos_keychains``, process.py), so the symlink skip
      protects that keychain data as well.
    * Skipping is also sufficient: unlinking an entry needs write
      permission on its PARENT directory -- which the sweep grants via
      the walk's own directory chmods -- never on the entry's target.
    * ``os.walk`` never follows symlinked directories either
      (``followlinks=False``), so recursion cannot escape the workspace
      through a linked directory.

    Both rmtree passes ignore errors and every chmod is individually
    suppressed, so this function cannot raise.

    """OpenAI-compatible client facade driving Antigravity CLI.

    Async compatibility boundary (issue #8)
    --------------------------------------
    Hermes drives this client from its async auxiliary path: with
    ``HERMES_SKIP_ASYNC_WRAP`` the client is used as-is ("already async-safe"),
    and the caller then does ``await client.chat.completions.create(...)``.
    Everything the facade returns is therefore awaitable-yielding-itself —
    ``stream._AwaitableCompletion`` for the non-streaming plan (which simply
    wraps the already-assembled response) and ``stream.AntigravityStream`` for
    the streaming plan (awaitable plus ``async for`` via ``__anext__``). Sync
    callers are untouched: the objects keep the same attributes and the same
    blocking behavior, so no existing caller needs to change.

    Known limitation (documented on purpose, not fixed here): the non-streaming
    ``create()`` executes the whole subprocess round-trip synchronously before
    it returns, so awaiting it still blocks the event loop for the request's
    duration. This is identical to the pre-existing sync behavior and to
    Hermes' own CopilotACPClient shim, and there is no plugin-side fix without
    a Hermes hook that would let ``create()`` hand back a coroutine instead of
    a finished value.
