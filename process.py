    degrades to False; the file scan in resolve_real_token_path() already
    covers those users.

    into its OWN process memory — libsecret's search sets
    SECRET_SEARCH_LOAD_SECRETS and it prints the secret to stdout (see

    Asymmetry worth knowing: with secret-tool present its rc-0 exact-pair

    "antigravity" matches the label branch and errs True.

    Cost, uncached (PR #2 adjudication): is_authenticated() runs per completion
    request, and one probe is marginal next to the agy child spawn this plugin
    also runs. Ceiling is ~20 s in the worst case (secret-tool 5 s, then up to
